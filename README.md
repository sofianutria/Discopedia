# 💿 Discopedia — Backend API 💿

Discopedia is a RESTful API to manage users, music records, and reviews. Users will eventually be able to create accounts, explore and create music records, and leave reviews. This backend is built using Java and Spring Boot, following modern practices such as DTOs, global exception handling, and secure authentication mechanisms (JWT planned).
